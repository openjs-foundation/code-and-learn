Code And Learn
==============

Code & Learn events allow you to get started (or go further) with popular open source projects from the [OpenJS Foundation](https://openjsf.org/projects). Experienced contributors help guide you through your first, second or third commit to the projects.

## Date and Times

December 13th, 2019
Palais des Congrès de Montréal

Location: TBD

Cost: free

The event is free and for everyone who wants to participate. See the [How To Participate](#how-to-participate) section to see how to register.

## Format

This years format is a little bit different than previous years. If you want to attend the event you can choose between multiple sessions that will take part or propose your own. Every session focuses on a specific area of one of the OpenJS Foundation projects (e.g. help contributing to the new [Node.js documentations page](https://nodejs.dev/)). You can find a list of proposed sessions [here](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/code-and-learn/labels/Session%20Proposal). Every session is hold in rather small groups and facilitated by a core member of the project.

We are welcoming everyone who wants to participate and learn something! It doesn't matter if you just started with Node.js or are already using it as part of your job.

## How To Participate

There is no registration necessary to attend this years Code&Learn however as orginizers we need to know who wants to participate so that we can plan accordingly. There are two ways how you can participate at Code&Learn:

#### Join a Proposed Session

Check out the list of already [proposed Code&Learn sessions](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/code-and-learn/labels/Session%20Proposal) and see if any of these sessions interest you. If so, give a 👍 on the issue thread so that we know you like to participate. By giving a 👍 you will be automatically registered to the event. If your plans are changing please make sure to remove it again.

#### Propose Your Session

If you are interested in contributing to a specific area that is not already covered in the proposed sessions you can [create a new issue](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/code-and-learn/issues/new?assignees=christian-bromann%2C+evahowe%2C+jorydotcom%2C+keywordnew&labels=Session+Proposal&template=session-proposal.md&title=Session+Topic%3A+) and we will try to find the appropiate faciliator of the project for it. Please understand that a proposed session needs to have at least 5-10 attendees that are also interested to contribute in the session.
